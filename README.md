# My First SEToolkit Experience: Website Cloning and Credential Harvesting

## Project Objective
This repository documents my first hands-on experience with the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SEToolkit).  
The main goal is to demonstrate, in a controlled and ethical environment:  
- Cloning a legitimate website.  
- Setting up a credential harvester to capture entered usernames and passwords.  

This is purely for **educational purposes** – to understand how phishing attacks work and highlight the importance of user awareness and security best practices.

## Important Disclaimer
**WARNING: This content is for educational and authorized testing purposes only.**

- The techniques shown here (website cloning and credential harvesting) simulate real-world phishing attacks.
- Phishing, unauthorized access to systems, or capturing credentials without explicit permission is **illegal** in most jurisdictions and can result in severe legal consequences.
- This repository and its author do **not** encourage, support, or condone any illegal activities.
- Use this information **only** in controlled lab environments (e.g., virtual machines you own) or with written consent for penetration testing.
- I am **not responsible** for any misuse, damage, or legal issues arising from the application of these techniques.
- Always follow ethical guidelines and local laws. Ethical hacking means improving security, not harming others.

Inspired by the official SEToolkit disclaimer: "This is only for testing purposes and can only be used where strict consent has been given. Do not use this for illegal purposes."
